"""
APScheduler — runs pull-bills on a cadence so new monthly bills land
automatically. Also fires per-CLIENT report deliveries based on each
client's report_frequency (falls back to tenant.report_frequency).

Schedule:
  - every 6 hours: enqueue pull_bills jobs for all active tenants
  - every 1 minute: drain the job queue
  - every Monday at 09:00 UTC: deliver to weekly clients
  - 1st of every month at 09:00 UTC: deliver to monthly clients
  - 1st of Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct at 09:00 UTC: deliver to quarterly clients
